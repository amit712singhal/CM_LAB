## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to the ES-251 [Computational Methods Lab](LAB_Syllabus.jpg) course instructed by Dr. Nishu Gupta. The course covers various numerical methods and techniques used in computational mathematics, including the Bisection Method, Newton-Raphson Method, Secant Method, Lagrange's Interpolation Formula, Newton's Divided Difference, Trapezoidal Rule, Simpson's 1/3 Rule, Simpson's 3/8 Rule, Gauss-Jordan Method, Power Method, and Runge-Kutta Method. It provides practical implementations and hands-on experience with these methods through various C++ programs.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
